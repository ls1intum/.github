# Button

The Button component is a fundamental UI element that triggers actions or events when clicked. It supports multiple visual variants to indicate different levels of importance and intent.

## Playground

<Primary />
<Controls />

Buttons are used to trigger actions or events, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.

## Variants

The Button component supports several variants to indicate different levels of importance and intent:

### Primary
Use for the main action on a page, such as "Submit" or "Save". This button attracts the most attention, so use it carefully.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

### Secondary
Use for less prominent actions that do not require the same level of attention as the primary action, such as "Cancel" or "Back".

<Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

### Text
Use for less prominent actions that don't need a background. Good for secondary actions in toolbars or navigation.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Text} />

### Success
Use for actions that indicate a successful operation, such as "Confirm" or "Approve". This button is used to indicate that the action was successful.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Success} />

### Info
Use for informational actions or to provide additional context.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Info} />

### Warning
Use for actions that require caution or attention.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Warning} />

### Danger
Use for actions that are potentially destructive, such as "Delete" or "Remove".

<Story of={ButtonStories.Danger} />

## Additional Styles

### Icon Button
Buttons can include icons to provide visual cues about their actions.

<Story of={ButtonStories.IconButton} />

### Loading Button
Show a loading state to indicate that an action is in progress.

<Story of={ButtonStories.LoadingButton} />

### Outlined Button
Use outlined buttons for a lighter, less prominent appearance.

<Story of={ButtonStories.OutlinedButton} />

## Sizes

Buttons come in different sizes to accommodate various use cases and design requirements:

### Small
Use for compact interfaces or when space is limited. Ideal for toolbars, tables, or dense layouts.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Small} />

### Normal
The default size, suitable for most use cases. Use this size for standard buttons in forms and general UI elements.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Normal} />

### Large
Use for prominent actions or when you want to draw more attention to the button. Good for call-to-action buttons or important form submissions.

<Story of={ButtonStories.Large} />

## Usage

```typescript
import { ButtonModule } from 'primeng/button';

// In your component template:
<p-button label="Submit"></p-button>

// Secondary button
<p-button label="Cancel" severity="secondary"></p-button>

// Danger button
<p-button label="Delete" severity="danger"></p-button>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Button Labels**: Use clear, action-oriented labels that describe what will happen when the button is clicked.
2. **Variant Selection**: Choose the variant based on the importance and context of the action:
   - Use Primary for the main action
   - Use Secondary for supporting actions
   - Use Danger for destructive actions
3. **Button Placement**: Place buttons in a logical order, typically with the primary action on the right and secondary actions on the left.
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure buttons have proper ARIA labels and are keyboard accessible.
