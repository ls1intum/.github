## Welcome üôå

### About Us üë•
Welcome to the GitHub organization of the [Research Group Applied Education Technologies](https://ase.cit.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). We are a team dedicated to advancing the fields of applied software engineering and education technologies. Our mission is to address the complex challenges of a rapidly changing world through agile methods and continuous software engineering. We love to build open source software for education purposes and to advance the field with innovative technologies involving artificial intelligence with a focus on usability and user experience.

### Our Mission üéØ
We collaborate with industry and academic partners to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative methods and solutions. Our focus is on creating learning platforms and conducting empirical research to enhance education. We apply educational technologies (e.g. [Artemis](https://artemisapp.github.io) and [Iris](https://ase.cit.tum.de/posts/2023-07-06-iris-announcement)) and artificial intelligence to improve learning and teaching experiences. Our goal is to actively involve students in the learning process, preparing them for future challenges through engaging, practical courses that involve real-world clients‚Äîand we ensure they have fun along the way.

### Resources üìö
We maintain extensive documentation and resources to support your work:

- **[ASE Group Website](https://ase.cit.tum.de)**: Visit our website to learn more about our research, ongoing projects, and latest publications.
- **Project-Specific Docs**: Each repository includes a `README` with specific details about the project, including setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and technical references.

### Fun Facts üéâ
We believe in working hard and playing hard. Our team has a shared love for collaborative learning. We regurlarly conduct doctoral seminars with hiking ‚õ∞Ô∏è and skiing ‚õ∑Ô∏è activities and organize hackathons in the university ü§ì

### Contribution Guidelines üõ†

We encourage you to dive in and contribute to our projects. Here's how you can get started:

1. **Explore our repositories**: Check out the repositories available under our organization. Each repository includes detailed documentation to help you understand its purpose and how to contribute.
2. **Follow our coding standards**: We adhere to specific coding standards and practices to maintain consistency and quality across our projects. Please review the contribution guidelines within each repository before submitting your work.
3. **Join discussions**: Engage with the team in issue tracking, pull requests, and discussions. Your insights and feedback are invaluable.

#### Identity and Transparency üÜî

To ensure a transparent and trustworthy environment, we have established different guidelines for members of our organization and external contributors.

#### For Members of Our Organization üë§

1. **Real Names Required**: As a member of our organization, you must use your full real name in your GitHub profile. This is a prerequisite for joining our organization. Using a real name is crucial for building trust within the team and the broader community. It fosters accountability and transparency, which are essential for collaborative work. When members use their real identities, it encourages open communication and strengthens professional relationships. Furthermore, it aligns with best practices in open-source communities, where transparency is key to ensuring the integrity and reliability of contributions.

2. **Profile Picture**: Members are required to upload an authentic profile picture. Use a clear, professional image and avoid comic-like pictures, memojis, or other non-authentic picture styles. Using a professional and authentic profile picture is essential for establishing credibility and fostering trust within the community. It helps others easily identify and connect with you, which is crucial for effective collaboration. By using a real photo, you present yourself as a serious and committed contributor, which in turn encourages others to take your work and interactions seriously. Avoiding non-authentic images ensures that the focus remains on the substance of your contributions rather than on distractions or misunderstandings that might arise from informal or unprofessional visuals.

3. **Direct Branching and PR Creation**: As a member, you are encourages to create branches and pull requests (PRs) directly within the repository. Please follow the internal branching and code review processes outlined in the respective repository.

#### For External Contributors üåç

1. **Identity Verification**: External contributions will only be considered if the contributor uses their real name and an authentic profile picture (see above). This ensures accountability and trustworthiness in all external contributions.

2. **Forking the Repository**: External contributors fork the repository and work on changes in their own branches.

3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your work is complete, submit a pull request for review. Ensure that your branch is up to date with the main branch before submitting.

4. **Compliance**: Contributions from external contributors that do not adhere to these guidelines may not be accepted.

#### References and Best Practices üìú

- We align our guidelines with the [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies) which stress the importance of authenticity and transparency in user profiles.
- For more insights on contributing to open-source projects, we recommend reviewing the [Open Source Guides by GitHub](https://opensource.guide/).

By following these guidelines, we foster a collaborative environment built on mutual trust and respect, essential for the success of our project.

#### Contribution Process üîÑ

1. **External contributors only**: Fork the Repository and create a branch.
2. **Create a feature branch**: Work on your changes in a separate branch.
3. **Submit a pull request**: Once your work is complete, submit a pull request for review.

Thank you for your contributions and for helping us maintain a high standard of quality and trust in this project.
