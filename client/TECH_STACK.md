# 🚀 Recommended Client Tech-Stack  

## Introduction  
When developing modern web applications, choosing the right client libraries is essential for maintaining **efficiency**, **consistency**, and **usability**. Below are our recommended UI libraries to help you build **high-quality applications** with a streamlined development process.  

## 🎨 UI Library  
We recommend the following **UI libraries** for different frameworks:  

### 1️⃣ **Prime Faces** (⭐ Preferred Option)  
PrimeNG (for Angular), PrimeReact (for React), and PrimeVue (for Vue) offer a **rich set of UI components** with a professional design, ensuring a **consistent look and feel** across different projects. These libraries provide:  
✅ A **wide variety** of pre-styled components.  
🌍 **Built-in** accessibility and internationalization support.  
🎨 **Customizable** themes and styling options.  
📚 **Comprehensive documentation** and active community support.  
📊 Integrated **data tables, form controls, charts, and more**.  

🛠️ We are working on a **custom AET theme** that can be imported to apply the **Design UI guidelines from AET** inside your project.  

### 2️⃣ **ShadCN / Spartan-NG** (Alternative Option)  
For projects that require a **lightweight and highly customizable approach**, we recommend:  
- **ShadCN (for React) ⚛️**: A minimalist yet flexible UI kit built on top of **Radix UI**, offering **unstyled but accessible** components.  
- **Spartan-NG (for Angular) 🅰️**: A modular component library inspired by **ShadCN**, providing a **clean and modern approach** to UI development.
